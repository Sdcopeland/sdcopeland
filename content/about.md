# About Me

Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Shawn (they/them). I am a Denver based progressive political and data professional. I spend most of my time taking apart code and systems. I like mountains and sometimes I climb them.

I want to write about data, AI, and how we can use them to affect social change. Additionally, I write poetry and longform thougths on how technology and humanism intersect. I want to think about how we can use tools in subversive ways to better ourselves and the work we are called to.

# About Website

The website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and a modified version of the [PaperMod](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-papermod/) theme. The website is served using github pages and has an automatic build function that regenerates the website upon commit. You can see the code for this website at [github](https://github.com/Sdcopeland/civiclabs.io).

This allows for an incredibly quick and light website that is easy for regular updates. There is no server side code running, no cookies or analytic trackers because I want to know nothing about you that you don't freely share with me.
