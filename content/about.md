# About Me

I am a Denver based progressive political and data professional. I spend most of my time taking apart code and systems. I like mountains and sometimes I climb them.

# About Website

The website is built using Hugo and a modified version of the PaperMod theme. The website is served using github pages and has an automatic build function that regenerates the website upon commit. You can see the code for this website at github.

This allows for an incredibly quick and light website that is easy for regular updates. There is no server side code running, no cookies or analytic trackers because I want to know nothing about you that you don't freely share with me.
