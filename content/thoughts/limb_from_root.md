# Limb From Root
There is an olive tree in  
Mouriscas planted when  
we first used bronze.  
Just a kid.  


It grew and gave fruit to  
generation after  
generation.  
Was it freely offered?  

Three official churches  
and counting, plague or  
two. Untold conflict.  
But it stayed. Planted.  

It has seen the best and worst  
in us and I can't help but  
wonder.  
Is it happy?  

How can it not be like me  
and want to rip its roots  
from limb and see  
something new?
